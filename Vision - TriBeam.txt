//Acquire a robot from Midtown or terminal once you are able to put a point into A.I. Hack.  Also be sure to level the robot up as you level.  Not super crucial, but don't be level 60 with a level 10 robot.
//For endgame, grab a max level yellow (elite) robot with Commanding Aura affix.  AIM Incinerators are best in slot robots, but take what you can get.
