//Emma Frost no longer REQUIRES a pet.  I believe a pet is still advantageous though, but I will leave it up to the user.  
//For Emma Frost - Diamond specifically, it is important to note that not having a pet provides you with an additional 5% damage reduction.  
//If you want a pet, anything will do while leveling.  For endgame, grab a max level yellow (elite) enemy with Commanding Aura affix.  King Kahuna in Bronx Zoo Aquarium is guaranteed to have Commanding Aura. Another good option is AIM Incinerator's.
