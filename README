-Please take special note of instructions for the following characters:

-Rogue - Leveling: This Rogue ability file is solely used to level without gaining any stolen powers whatsoever.  I highly recommend leveling her on a Monday in Midtown to take advantage of the massive xp acquireable there.  I've also added Vanish teleport support from Kirigi.  I highly recommend acquiring his teleport if possible.

-Magik - Summoner: Acquire a minion from anywhere once you are able to put a point into Eternal Servitude.  This will change the ability name to Back From Limbo.  A re-prep may be necessary.  Also be sure to level the minion up as you level.  Not super crucial, but don't be level 60 with a level 10 minion.  EVERY TIME Magik get's respecced, it erases her pet.  You'll have to go get another one.

-Spiderman: Apparently some of Spiderman's costumes change the roster list and/or name of his abilities.  Please let me know if you have any of the costumes and if they change anything, as I don't have any costumes for him.

-Emma Frost: Emma Frost no longer REQUIRES a pet.  I believe a pet is still advantageous though, but I will leave it up to the user.  For Emma Frost - Diamond specifically, it is important to note that not having a pet provides you with an additional 5% damage reduction.  If you want a pet, anything will do while leveling.  For endgame, grab a max level yellow (elite) enemy with Commanding Aura affix.  King Kahuna in Bronx Zoo Aquarium is guaranteed to have Commanding Aura. Another good option is AIM Incinerator's.

-Vision: Acquire a robot from Midtown once you are able to put a point into A.I. Hack.  Also be sure to level the robot up as you level.  Not super crucial, but don't be level 60 with a level 10 robot.
